            //The string data type is used to represent textual data (i.e. sequences of characters). Strings are created using single or double quotes surrounding one or more characters.
            var first_name = "Lets";//The String Data Type
            var last_name = 'Upgrade';//The String Data Type
            console.log(first_name);
            console.log(last_name);

            //The number data type is used to represent positive or negative numbers with or without decimal place, or numbers written using exponential notation e.g. 1.5e-4 (equivalent to 1.5x10-4).
            var age = 25;//The Number Data Type
            var pi = 3.14//The Number Data Type
            console.log(age);
            console.log(pi);

            //The Boolean data type can hold only two values: true or false. It is typically used to store values like yes (true) or no (false), on (true) or off (false)
            var isLearning = true;//The Boolean Data Type
            var isReading = false;//The Boolean Data Type
            console.log(isLearning);
            console.log(isReading);

            //The undefined data type can only have one value-the special value undefined. If a variable has been declared, but has not been assigned a value, has the value undefined.
            var num1; //The Undefined Data Type
            console.log(num1);

            //This is another special data type that can have only one value-the null value. A null value means that there is no value. It is not equivalent to an empty string ("") or 0, it is simply nothing.
            var a = null;//The Null Data Type
            console.log(a);

            //The object is a complex data type that allows you to store collections of data.
            //An object contains properties, defined as a key-value pair. A property key (name) is always a string, but the value can be any data type, like strings, numbers, booleans, or complex data types like arrays, function and other objects.
            var car = {
                "modal": "BMW X3",
                "color": "white",
                "doors": 5
                }//The Object Data Type   
            console.log(car);

            //An array is a type of object used for storing multiple values in single variable. Each value (also called an element) in an array has a numeric position, known as its index, and it may contain data of any data type-numbers, strings, booleans, functions, objects, and even other arrays. The array index starts from 0
            var colors = ["Red", "Yellow", "Green", "Orange"];//The Array Data Type
            console.log(colors);

            //The function is callable object that executes a block of code. Since functions are objects, so it is possible to assign them to variables
            var greeting = function(){ 
               return "Hello World!"; 
                }//The Function Data Type
            console.log(greeting());
